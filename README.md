## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I finally learn how to use Git and GitHub and will never go back to the old ways. I also tried to ensure that the HTML and CSS codes are clean.

## Continued development

I will continue to learn and apply ways to ensure that my codes are clean and consistent, and easy to read as well.
